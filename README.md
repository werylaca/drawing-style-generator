Laca-style Portrait Generator v3.1

A React-based web application that uses Google Gemini AI to transform photos and images into professional, noise-filtered black and white graphite sketches.

What is "Laca-style"?

The "Laca-style" is a unique visual algorithm built on the following artistic principles:

0% Color: Pure black and white graphite experience for every image.

Intelligent Isolation: Automatically removes the background and places the subject in a clean, white environment.

Artistic Texture: Mimics real pencil strokes and professional cross-hatching.

Noise-Filtered Surfaces: Minimal digital grain for a clean, sophisticated, and aesthetic result.

Detail Preservation: Precisely keeps facial features, textures, and important details of any object.
